## Important Prerequisites

1. Understand [the WordPress template hierarchy](http://codex.wordpress.org/images/9/96/wp-template-hierarchy.jpg)

## Development Guidelines

- Avoid committing the built theme to the project repository
- Avoid making changes directly to the built theme -- Always use the build process
- In production avoid uploading the theme development directory to a public server
- Avoid committing the `wp-uploads` directory to the project repository
- It is good practice to enable `WP_DEBUG` in your `wp-config.php` file, *but only* during development

## Standard Theme Development Process

### Development

1. Install WordPress and clear it of unnecessary default themes & plugins
1. Clone/Download this repository into a directory in your WordPress `wp-content/themes` directory
1. Change the `package.json` with your new theme's configuration
1. Open the terminal and `cd wp-content/themes/<themename>`
1. Run `npm install` to install all dev dependencies
1. Run `gulp` to begin the dev build process that uses libsass, browsersync and webpack
1. Log in to the admin and enable the *built theme*
1. Develop your theme in the `/assets` and `/theme` directories, the built theme will be generated by gulp

### Production

1. Delete files you are not using from inside the `/theme` directory
1. [Add a screenshot.png](http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Development#Screenshot)
1. Before deploying run `gulp --build`
1. Deploy the built theme directory, *not the dev directory*
