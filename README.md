# The Mozaik WordPress Theme Boilerplate

The goals of the boilerplate are to:

1. be a product used and produced by the entire team (suggestions, issues and pull requests are welcome and encouraged)
1. be easy to set up / easy to use
1. guide the development process to be consistent where it can be
1. offer a robust development and build workflow (currently powered by the cli and gulp)
1. make getting off the ground with a new project really fast

1. Change the `WP_DEBUG` const to `true` in the WordPress `wp-config.php` file <-- under consideration
1. Open the terminal and `cd wp-content/themes/<themename>` <-- bummer, but hey
1. Run `npm install` to install all dev dependencies
1. Run `gulp` to begin the dev build process with gulp watch and browsersync <-- Not implemented yet!
1. Log in to the admin and enable the *built theme*
