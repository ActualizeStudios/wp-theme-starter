# Mozaik Theme Bootstrap - Library

The Library is a collection of potentially useful custom WordPress related classes
and functions.

# How to use

To use them in your theme, **copy the ones you want to use into the `theme/includes` folder
of your dev theme**. Do **not** simply try to include them from within the library as that will
not work in the built theme
